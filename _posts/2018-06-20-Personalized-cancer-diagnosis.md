# Problem statement
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

### Data sources
Get the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data).  

We have two data files: one contains the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations. Both these data files have a common column called `ID`.  

Data file's information:  
* training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
* training_text (ID, Text)
