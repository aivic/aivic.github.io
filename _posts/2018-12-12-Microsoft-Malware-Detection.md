# Problem statement
To detect what type of malware is present in the file

### Data Source
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data)  

For every malware, we have two files
* [.asm file](https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/asm)
* .bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header)

Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files and 150GB of data is .asm files:

There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files  

There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data -  
* Ramnit
* Lollipop
* Kelihos_ver3
* Vundo
* Simda
* Tracur
* Kelihos_ver1
* Obfuscator.ACY
* Gatak

# Mapping to a ML problem
There are 9 classes under target variable hence a multi-class classfication problem with metric to be used a log-loss metric.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
First of all, we separate both file types into different folders.

### Distribution of malware classes in whole data set

## Feature Extraction

* File size of byte files as a feature
