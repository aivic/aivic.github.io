---

**Just another weekend fun**  
This project focuses upon following aspects:

* Comparision among the frequency of Incoming/Outgoing/Missed calls.
* What is the busiest hour
* What is the busiest day
* Top users to whom calls were made (Outgoing) (Family and Friends separately)
* Same top users but variation in outgoing calls through various months (Family and Friends separately)


NOTE
* *The data was extracted using Call History Manager v4.3 app available for Android users on playstore.*  
* *The output is not shown due to privacy.*
  

The project code is available here: [Call log analyzer](https://github.com/vivekec/datascience/tree/gh-pages/projects/misc/call_log_analyzer)
