excerpt: "Interactive Visualization of skills on LinkedIn"
---

**A weekend fun**  
Objective is to create a dashboard consisting of skills provided on LinkedIn and other common user details.  
Implemented using D3.js and Plotly.  
Currently you need to hard-code the values to *interests.html* and *user.html* files for visualizations.  
  
The project is available here: [LinkedIn Dashboard](https://github.com/vivekec/datascience/tree/gh-pages/projects/LIN%20dash)
